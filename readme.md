<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
  This project was to create a trivia game that utilizes flexbox and local storage. The game is simple answer as many questions as you can before the time is up. Wrong answers cost you to lose 5 seconds and correct answers scores you a point. At the end you can save your score in local storage to try and beat at a later date. Currently it displays the first 6 scores stored in local storage. There is also a button to clear out your local storage so you can make new saves.
